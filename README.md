# coursera2020-machineLearning
This repository contains the files I used to complete the various components of the open access Coursera Machine Learning course instructed by Andrew Ng as of January 2020. Depending on your interest in my content, please first consider the academic integrity notes provided by the course developers. Link to course landing page: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning

Please also note that I have tried my best to contrain script/data contributions to the designated areas as highlighted by the course instructors (see example header below). I do not take credit for the other work.
